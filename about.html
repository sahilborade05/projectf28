                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>
                    Founded in 2023, Srushti Travels was born from a
                    passion for travel and the open road. We noticed that
                    while air and rail transport had many resources, there 
                    was a gap in road transport services that could cater to
                    all types of travelers. That’s why we set out to create
                    a platform that brings together the best routes, 
                    vehicle options, and real-time travel information—all
                    in one place. Today, we are proud to serve thousands of travelers who share our love for the road.</p>
